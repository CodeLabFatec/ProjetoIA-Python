Detect people in all kinds of scenarios using this generalized dataset.

For this dataset, we curated images and annotations from various projects from Universe to create a well performing model regardless of scenario by pulling from a variety of specialized datasets.

We selected data that ranged in type, context, annotation size, annotation count and cameras.
